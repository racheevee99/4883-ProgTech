## 12403 - Save Setu
### Rachel Vetter 
### Description:

Rahaduzzaman Setu, (Roll - 12) of 13th batch, CSE, University of Dhaka is tremendously ill. He has
been suffering from Multi Drug Resistant TB for a long time. Now, his left lung is damaged and
beyond repair. No medicine is working on his body to ease his pain. It is urgent to operate on his left
lung so that the disease doesn’t spread to his right lung. It can either be removed through surgery
or transplanted. He comes from a modest family and it is difficult and impossible for them to bare
his medical expenses anymore. Because of the money needed (12 million BDT) to transplant, it is his
family’s decision to go with the surgery (3 million BDT). We must help them financially by raising
money. But we must not be confined with that amount only to do the surgery. We must go for the
Transplant. Our target will be to collect as much as possible to help our friend.
If anyone wants to contribute now, please send me your contribution or contact me. Please contribute
as much as you can to save a life that you saw every week for the first two years of your University life.
Please contribute as per your abilities. Our combined effort may save a life.

However, in this problem, you have to build a software that can calculate the donations. Initially
the total amount of money is 0 and in each time, two types of operations will be there.
1) ‘donate K’ (100 ≤ K ≤ 105
), then you have to add K to the account.
2) ‘report’, report all the money currently in the account
