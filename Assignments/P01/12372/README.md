## 12372 - Packing for Holiday
### Rachel Vetter 
### Description:

Mr. Bean used to have a lot of problems packing
his suitcase for holiday. So he is very careful for
this coming holiday. He is more serious this time
because he is going to meet his fiance and he is
also keeping frequent communication with you
as a programmer friend to have suggestions. He
gets confused when he buys a gift box for his
fiance because he can’t decide whether it will fit
in his suitcase or not. Sometimes a box doesn’t
fit in his suitcase in one orientation and after
rotating the box to a different orientation it fits
in the suitcase. This type of behavior makes him
puzzled.
So to make things much simpler he bought another suitcase having same length, width and height,
which is 20 inches. This measurement is taken from inside of the box. So a box which has length,
width and height of 20 inches will just fit in this suitcase. He also decided to buy only rectangular
shaped boxes and keep a measuring tape in his pocket. Whenever he chooses one gift box, which must
be rectangular shaped, he quickly measures the length, width and height of the box. But still he can’t
decide whether it will fit in his suitcase or not. Now he needs your help. Please write a program for
him which calculates whether a rectangular box fits in his suitcase or not provided the length, width
and height of the box. Note that, sides of the box must be parallel to the sides of the suitcase.
