## 11988 - Broken Keyboard
### Rachel Vetter 
### Description:

You’re typing a long text with a broken keyboard. Well it’s not so badly broken. The only problem
with the keyboard is that sometimes the “home” key or the “end” key gets automatically pressed
(internally).
You’re not aware of this issue, since you’re focusing on the text and did not even turn on the
monitor! After you finished typing, you can see a text on the screen (if you turn on the monitor).
In Chinese, we can call it Beiju. Your task is to find the Beiju text.
